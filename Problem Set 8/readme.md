## [1.	Implement a “Delete Back” function to delete the last(back) element of the Linked List. (Check Underflow).](https://github.com/1915002510/cse214/blob/main/Problem%20Set%208/1.c)

## [2.	Implement a “Delete Front” function to delete the first(front) element of the Linked List. (Check Underflow).](https://github.com/1915002510/cse214/blob/main/Problem%20Set%208/2.c)

## [3.	Implement a “Delete Value” function to delete a value (key) from the Linked List. Take input the delete ‘key’ from user. (Check Underflow and Not Found).](https://github.com/1915002510/cse214/blob/main/Problem%20Set%208/3.c)

## [4.	Implement a “Delete At” function to delete the nth element of the Linked List. Take input ‘n’ from user.(Check Underflow and index out of range) (Let, for the first element n = 1).](https://github.com/1915002510/cse214/blob/main/Problem%20Set%208/4.c)

## [5.	Implement a “Clear” function to delete the all the element of the Linked List.](https://github.com/1915002510/cse214/blob/main/Problem%20Set%208/5.c)

## [6.	Implement a "Delete After" function to delete an element before a node with value 'key' of the Linked List. Take input 'key' and new node value from user. (Check underflow and index out of range).](https://github.com/1915002510/cse214/blob/main/Problem%20Set%208/6.c)

## [7.	Implement a “Clear” function to delete the all the element of the Linked List.](https://github.com/1915002510/cse214/blob/main/Problem%20Set%208/7.c)
